# 1. General Description

## Dataset Overview

The WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset was collected by the Web Algorithmics Lab at Università degli Studi di Milano to support the Web Spam Challenge 2008 competition. This dataset represents a comprehensive collection of web hosts from the .UK domain, aimed at developing and evaluating methods for detecting web spam.

## Dataset Purpose and Collection

-   **Collection Purpose**: To provide a standardized dataset for web spam detection research and competition
-   **Collection Entity**: Web Algorithmics Lab, Università degli Studi di Milano
-   **Domain Coverage**: .UK domain websites
-   **Primary Task**: Binary classification (spam vs. non-spam websites)

## Dataset Scale

-   **Total Hosts**: 114,529 websites in the .UK domain
-   **Labeled Samples**:
    -   Training Set (SET1): 3,998 samples
    -   Test Set (SET2): 2,055 samples
    -   Note: In this analysis, we combine both sets for comprehensive evaluation
-   **Domain Structure**: Based on third-level domains to prevent training/test contamination

## Label Categories

-   **Spam**: Websites identified as spam
-   **Non-spam**: Legitimate websites
-   **Undecided**: Uncertain cases (excluded from modeling)

2.  **Link-based Features (Transformed)**:
    -   Number of features: 138
    -   Types: Various transformed link metrics
    -   Includes ratios and logarithmic transformations of link-based characteristics
3.  **Content-based Features**:
    -   Number of features: 96
    -   Types: Text and content characteristics
    -   Derived from website content analysis

> This chunk sets up the R environment and loads necessary libraries for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Feature Analysis and Standardization Requirements

> This chunk creates comprehensive summaries of each feature set, including the number of features, sample sizes, missing values, and value ranges to determine standardization requirements.

```{r feature-summaries}
# Function to create feature summary
create_feature_summary <- function(data, feature_set_name) {
  # Remove ID and label columns

> This chunk implements the data cleaning and standardization process for each feature set, handling missing values and normalizing features to ensure comparable scales.
>
> > All features were standardized using Z-score normalization (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) via R's scale() function. As a result, the normalized values may be negative or exceed 1, which is expected and appropriate for models such as logistic regression and SVM.

# 3. Classification Methods Selection and Implementation

### Model Selection Strategy

For each feature set, we need to select and implement the most appropriate classification method based on the characteristics of the features and the nature of our binary classification problem. Here's our analysis and justification for each feature set:

### 1. Set 1: Direct Features (2 features)

-   **Selected Method**: Logistic Regression
-   **Justification**:
    -   Very small number of features (only 2)
    -   Simple, interpretable model suitable for low-dimensional data
    -   Efficient for binary classification
    -   Provides probability outputs for AUC calculation
    -   No need for complex feature selection or parameter tuning
-   **Additional Considerations**:
    -   Features are already standardized in preprocessing
    -   L2 regularization will be used to prevent overfitting

> This chunk implements logistic regression for the direct features set, including model training, prediction, and performance evaluation. Both single split ROC and CV AUC are computed.

```{r direct-features-model}
library(caret)
library(pROC)

set.seed(42)
direct_idx <- createDataPartition(direct_clean$is_spam, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
direct_train <- direct_clean[direct_idx, ] %>% select(is_spam, number_of_pages, length_of_hostname)
direct_test <- direct_clean[-direct_idx, ] %>% select(is_spam, number_of_pages, length_of_hostname)

direct_model <- glm(is_spam ~ ., data = direct_train, family = "binomial")
direct_pred_prob <- predict(direct_model, direct_test, type = "response")
direct_pred_label <- ifelse(direct_pred_prob >= 0.5, 1, 0)
direct_cm <- caret::confusionMatrix(factor(direct_pred_label), factor(direct_test$is_spam), positive = "1")
direct_precision <- direct_cm$byClass["Precision"]
direct_recall <- direct_cm$byClass["Recall"]
direct_f1 <- direct_cm$byClass["F1"]

# direct_roc is used in step 4 for comparsion
direct_roc <- roc(direct_test$is_spam, direct_pred_prob)

# CV AUC (only numeric features)
# 5 折交叉验证（Cross-Validation）计算平均 AUC
cv_folds <- createFolds(direct_clean$is_spam, k = 5, list = TRUE, returnTrain = FALSE)
direct_auc_cv <- mean(sapply(cv_folds, function(idx) {
  train <- direct_clean[-idx, ] %>% select(is_spam, number_of_pages, length_of_hostname)
  test <- direct_clean[idx, ] %>% select(is_spam, number_of_pages, length_of_hostname)
  model <- glm(is_spam ~ ., data = train, family = "binomial")
  pred <- predict(model, test, type = "response")
  auc(roc(test$is_spam, pred, quiet=TRUE))
}))
cat("\nDirect Features 5-fold CV Mean AUC:", round(direct_auc_cv, 4), "\n")

# 检查预测标签分布
cat("Direct pred label table:\n")
print(table(direct_pred_label))
cat("Direct test true label table:\n")
print(table(direct_test$is_spam))
```

### 2. Set 2: Link-based Features (138 features) 

-   **Selected Method**: Random Forest
-   **Justification**:
    -   High-dimensional feature space (138 features)
    -   Excellent performance with high-dimensional data
    -   Built-in feature importance evaluation
    -   Robust to different scales and non-linear relationships
    -   Handles class imbalance well with proper weighting
-   **Additional Considerations**:
    -   Will use class weights to address imbalance
    -   No need for additional feature scaling

> This chunk implements random forest classification for the link-based features, including single split ROC and CV AUC.

```{r link-features-model}
library(randomForest)
library(pROC)
library(caret)

# Link features: single split for ROC, CV for AUC
set.seed(42)
link_train_index <- createDataPartition(link_clean$is_spam, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
link_train <- link_clean[link_train_index, ]
link_test <- link_clean[-link_train_index, ]

# Single split model for ROC
# 处理不平衡
class_weights <- ifelse(link_train$is_spam == 1,
                       (1/table(link_train$is_spam)[2]) * 0.5,
                       (1/table(link_train$is_spam)[1]) * 0.5)
#单次训练模型用于ROC画图（500棵树）
link_model <- randomForest(factor(is_spam) ~ ., data = link_train, weights = class_weights, ntree = 500, importance = TRUE)
link_pred_prob <- predict(link_model, link_test, type = "prob")[,2]
link_roc <- roc(link_test$is_spam, link_pred_prob)

# 5-fold cross validation for AUC（200棵树）
cv_folds <- createFolds(link_clean$is_spam, k = 5, list = TRUE, returnTrain = FALSE)

}))

# Link Features 混淆矩阵和指标
link_pred_label <- ifelse(link_pred_prob >= 0.5, 1, 0)

link_precision <- link_cm$byClass["Precision"]
link_recall <- link_cm$byClass["Recall"]
link_f1 <- link_cm$byClass["F1"]
```

### 3. Set 3: Content-based Features (96 features) 

-   **Selected Method**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel
-   **Justification**:
    -   Medium-dimensional feature space (96 features)
    -   Features are continuous statistical measures
    -   SVM with RBF kernel can capture non-linear relationships
    -   Effective for imbalanced datasets with proper class weights
    -   Works well with standardized features
-   **Additional Considerations**:
    -   Features are already standardized from preprocessing
    -   Will use cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

> This chunk implements SVM classification for the content-based features, including single split ROC and CV AUC.

```{r content-features-model}

```

# 4. Model Performance Comparison

> **Note:** AUC values in the table are from 5-fold cross-validation (CV) for each feature set, providing a robust estimate of model performance under data imbalance. ROC curves are from a single train/test split and are for visual comparison only. This approach is common in reports to balance scientific rigor and intuitive visualization.

### ROC/AUC Comparison and Interpretation

The table above summarizes the predictive performance of each feature set and classification method using 5-fold cross-validated AUC as the main metric. The ROC curves provide a visual comparison of model discrimination on a single train/test split.

#### Ranking of Feature Sets by Predictive Power (AUC)

1.  **`r model_comparison$Feature_Set[which.max(model_comparison$CV_AUC)]`** (AUC = `r round(max(model_comparison$CV_AUC), 4)`) — *Best predictive performance*
2.  **`r model_comparison$Feature_Set[order(model_comparison$CV_AUC, decreasing=TRUE)[2]]`** (AUC = `r round(sort(model_comparison$CV_AUC, decreasing=TRUE)[2], 4)`)
3.  **`r model_comparison$Feature_Set[which.min(model_comparison$CV_AUC)]`** (AUC = `r round(min(model_comparison$CV_AUC), 4)`) — *Poorest predictive performance*

#### Analysis and Comparison of Results

Based on the comprehensive metrics, we can analyze the performance of each feature set and classification method:

1. **Direct Features (Logistic Regression)**
   - *Performance Metrics*:
     - CV_AUC: 0.5245 (barely better than random)
     - Precision, Recall, F1: All 0.0000
   - *Strengths*:
     - Simple and interpretable model
     - Fast training and prediction
     - Works well with small feature sets
   - *Weaknesses*:
     - Severely underperforms in this spam detection task
     - Cannot capture complex patterns with only 2 features
     - Linear model limitations in handling non-linear relationships
   - *Context*: The poor performance suggests that basic host-level features (page count and domain length) are insufficient for spam detection.

2. **Link-based Features (Random Forest)**
   - *Performance Metrics*:
     - CV_AUC: 0.7345 (moderate performance)
     - Precision: 0.3542
     - Recall: 0.1589
     - F1: 0.2194
   - *Strengths*:
     - Handles high-dimensional data (138 features) effectively
     - Captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions
     - Robust to outliers and noise
     - Built-in feature importance evaluation
   - *Weaknesses*:
     - Low recall indicates missing many spam cases
     - Moderate precision suggests false positives
     - May be computationally intensive
   - *Context*: The link structure provides valuable information for spam detection, but the model struggles with class imbalance.

3. **Content-based Features (SVM with RBF)**
   - *Performance Metrics*:
     - CV_AUC: 0.7878 (best overall performance)
     - Precision: 0.2927
     - Recall: 0.3871
     - F1: 0.3333
   - *Strengths*:
     - Best overall performance in terms of CV_AUC
     - Highest recall among all models
     - Effective at capturing non-linear patterns in text
     - Good at handling medium-dimensional data (96 features)
   - *Weaknesses*:
     - Lower precision than link-based features
     - Sensitive to parameter tuning
     - Computationally intensive for large datasets
   - *Context*: Content features provide the most discriminative power for spam detection, with SVM effectively capturing textual patterns.

#### Discussion of Classification Methods in Context

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - *Suitability for Problem*: Not suitable for this spam detection task
   - *Reasoning*: The binary nature of spam detection requires capturing complex patterns that simple linear models cannot represent
   - *Recommendation*: Should be used only as a baseline or in combination with other features

2. **Random Forest**
   - *Suitability for Problem*: Well-suited for link-based features
   - *Reasoning*: 
     - Handles the high dimensionality of link features
     - Can capture complex relationships in the link structure
     - Provides feature importance insights
   - *Recommendation*: Good choice for link-based analysis, but needs class imbalance handling

3. **SVM with RBF Kernel**
   - *Suitability for Problem*: Best performing for content-based features
   - *Reasoning*:
     - Effective at capturing non-linear patterns in text
     - Works well with standardized features
     - Good at handling the medium-dimensional content feature space
   - *Recommendation*: Optimal choice for content-based spam detection

#### Overall Findings and Recommendations

1. **Feature Set Importance**:
   - Content features are most discriminative (highest CV_AUC)
   - Link features provide complementary information
   - Direct features add little value alone

2. **Model Selection Strategy**:
   - Use SVM for content-based analysis
   - Use Random Forest for link-based analysis
   - Consider ensemble methods combining both approaches

3. **Class Imbalance Handling**:
   - All models show signs of struggling with class imbalance
   - Higher recall in content-based model suggests better handling of minority class
   - Consider additional techniques like SMOTE or class weights

4. **Practical Deployment Considerations**:
   - Content-based SVM provides best overall performance
   - Link-based Random Forest offers good precision
   - Consider computational costs in production environment

# 5. Feature Set Combinations: Model Deployment and Comparison

### 5.1 Combination 1: Obvious Features (Set 1) + Link-based Features (Set 2) 

> We combined the obvious features and link-based features to leverage both simple host-level and complex graph-based information. Random Forest is chosen for its robustness to high-dimensional data and ability to model non-linear relationships.

```{r combo1-obvious-link}
# 合并特征集1和2
combo1 <- direct_with_labels %>%

### 5.2 Combination 2: Obvious Features (Set 1) + Content-based Features (Set 3)

### 5.4 Combination 4: All Features (Set 1 + Set 2 + Set 3) 

> We combined all three feature sets—obvious, link-based, and content-based features—to leverage the full spectrum of available information. Random Forest is used for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional, mixed-type data.

#### Qualitative Analysis

-   **Obvious + Link** This combination utilizes both simple site-level metrics and structural link data. The AUC of 0.7662 is modest, but the recall (0.1402) is very low, meaning the model misses many spam cases. While Random Forest handles link features well, the obvious features contribute little, and the overall spam detection is weak.

-   **Obvious + Content** The SVM (RBF) model captures subtle, non-linear textual patterns in content. Although the precision (0.3000) is slightly lower, the recall improves significantly to 0.3871, resulting in the highest F1-score (0.3380) among all combinations. This suggests it's relatively better at identifying spam correctly, even with fewer features.

-   **Link + Content** This combination balances structural and content signals. Random Forest delivers the second-highest AUC (0.8240) and a better balance of precision (0.5152) and recall (0.1828) compared to previous sets. It shows robustness across spam strategies, although F1-score (0.2698) remains slightly behind SVM.

-   **All Features** Using the full feature set yields the best overall AUC (0.8249) and the highest precision (0.5714). Recall (0.2151) improves over other Random Forest models, giving a strong F1-score of 0.3125. Although not the top in F1, this approach ensures stable, high-confidence predictions and is suitable when computational cost is acceptable.

⸻

🔍 **General Insights:** - Combining Link + Content is crucial — this pairing consistently outperforms combinations that include only one of the two. - SVM excels in recall and F1 when using content features, showing its strength in uncovering non-linear patterns. - Random Forest remains a solid choice for high-dimensional mixed-type features, offering stable AUC and precision. - If spam recall is a priority, SVM with content may be preferred; if balanced performance is key, Random Forest with all features is recommended.
